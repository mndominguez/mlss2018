# Nonparametric Bayesian Methods: Models, Algorithms, and Applications

## Abstract

This tutorial introduces Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP) as a tool for modern data science and machine learning. BNP methods are useful in a variety of data analyses---including density estimation without parametric assumptions and clustering models that adaptively determine the number of clusters. We will demonstrate that BNP allows the data analyst to learn more from a data set as the size of the data set grows and see how this feat is accomplished. We will study popular BNP models such as the Dirichlet process, Chinese restaurant process, Indian buffet process, and hierarchical BNP models---and how they relate to each other.
